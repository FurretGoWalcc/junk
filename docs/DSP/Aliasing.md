## Basics

>[!summary]- What is Aliasing
>- Aliasing is an effect of our [[Discrete-Time Signal|Discrete-Time]] definition that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (aliases of one another, when sampled)
>- In the example below, these two *different* waveforms appear identical when sampled
>	- ![[Pasted image 20221230134039.png]]
>- In other words, there's multiple solutions which satisfies the $x[n]$ for any given problem.

>[!danger]- When does Aliasing Occur + The *Nyquist Frequency*
>- Aliasing occurs when $$\large F_{signal} \ge \frac{F_{s}}{2}$$
>- The **Nyquist Frequency** $\large F_\text{Nyquist}=2|F_\text{signal}|<F_s$ defines the minimum which the sampling frequency must exceed to avoid aliasing, aka the maximum input frequency at a given sampling frequency to avoid aliasing.
