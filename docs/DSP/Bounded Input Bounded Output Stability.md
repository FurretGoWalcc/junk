>- *BIBO Stable* means that any bounded input will produce a bounded output.
>- An [[Discrete-Time Signal|DT]] [[Linear and Time Invariant Systems|LTI]] system is BIBO Stable if and only if h[n] is absolutely summable. This is easy to prove for signals which are finite in length, or those which are finite periodic sequencues, but some signals grow without bound. 
>- This is more or less a review of Calc2, divergence and convergence.
>$$\sum\limits_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}{\big|h[k]\big|}< \infty$$
