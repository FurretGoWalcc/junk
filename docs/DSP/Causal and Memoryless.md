>[!danger] Causal
>- A system is causal if for every x[n], y[n] at any n is not affected by x[m] where $m>n$
>- In other words, for [[Discrete-Time Signal|DT]] systems, to find a non-causal system's output would requires knowing input values which are in the future.

>[!alert] Memoryless
>- A system is memoryless if for every x[n], y[n] at any n is not affected by x[m] where $m<n$
>- In other words, for [[Discrete-Time Signal|DT]] Causal systems, to find a memoryless system's output would only require knowing the input at that point.
