>[!hint] The Basics
> - *Unit*: simple. These are building blocks for describing more complicated waveforms. 
> - The point of interest is n=0 by default, but can be shifted. I.e. at n=0, the unit ramp function changes slope.
> - See [[Discrete-Time Signal|Discrete-Time]]


>[!alert]+ Unit Impulse
>- The unit impulse is 1 where the inner term is 0, and 0 everywhere else.

>- **The Sifting Property of the Unit Impulse**: Because the impulse function is 1 in only 1 spot, we can chain unit impulse functions like so using the literal values of the output to create the equivalent [[Discrete-Time Signal|DT]] signal.
